# MIDIMarauder
midiMarauder is a TUI application for interacting with MIDI devices through USB. The idea is to have a MIDIOX like software for Linux machines.

For now it's just a proof of concept that MIDI messages can be received through USB and printed to the terminal via stdout.



# To Do:

* Automatically recognize every MIDI device connected âœ…
* Create TUI with [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview). - In progress
* Literally everything else.
  
# Demo (Outdated)
automatically detects both midi devices, listens for midi messages form every device that remains connected until there is none left and closes.
