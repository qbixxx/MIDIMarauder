# midiMarauder
midiMarauder aims to be a TUI application for interacting with MIDI devices through USB. The idea is to have a MIDIOX like software for Linux machines.

For now it's just a proof of concept that MIDI messages can be received through USB and printed to the terminal via stdout.



# To Do:

* Automatically recognize every MIDI device connected âœ…
* Create TUI with bubbletea.
* Literally everything else.


# Demo gif
automatically detects both midi devices, scans every one that remains connected until theres nothing left and closes.
