# midiMarauder
midiMarauder aims to be a TUI application for interacting with MIDI devices through USB. The idea is to have a MIDIOX like software but for Linux machines.

Right now the code is extremely bad, it needs to be re-written. But for now it is just a proof of concept that MIDI messages can be received through usb and printed to the terminal with stdout.
